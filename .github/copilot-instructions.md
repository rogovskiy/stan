## Communication Guidelines
- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.

## Rules of Engagement
- Do not reconfigure the project or install new frameworks without explicit confirmation from the user.
- Assume the project is configured correctly unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.
- Analyze the error before suggesting fixes, and avoid making assumptions. 

## Tooling
### Python
- always use venv - activate when starting a new terminal session.

### Next.JS
- you don't have to restart the server after installing new dependencies, just save a file and it will reload automatically.
- development server runs on port 3000 by default. 
- Read the log file at .next/dev/logs/next-development.log when getting server errors. Make sure to see the full error, which maybe longer than 10 lines.
