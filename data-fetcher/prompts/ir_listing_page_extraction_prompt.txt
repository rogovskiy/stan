You are analyzing the HTML content of an investor relations listing page to extract ALL financial documents and pagination links.

Page Title: {page_title}
Page URL: {page_url}

CRITICAL: Your goal is to extract EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT on this page. Do not miss any documents.

Your task:
1. Find ALL DOCUMENTS (financial filings, earnings releases, presentations, reports, press releases)
   - Look in tables, lists, divs, links - anywhere documents might be
   - Extract every PDF link, every document detail page link
   - Don't skip any documents, even if they seem less important
   
2. Identify PAGINATION LINKS ONLY (like "Next", "Page 2", etc.)
   - Only pagination for the same listing
   - Do NOT include navigation to other sections

For EACH AND EVERY DOCUMENT you find, extract:
- title: Document title/description (extract from link text, headings, or nearby content)
- category: Type (earnings_release, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, presentation, annual_report, proxy, press_release, financial_statements, etc.)
- link_type: "pdf_download" if direct PDF link, or "details_page" if it leads to a page with the document
- url: The FULL URL (convert relative URLs to absolute using the page URL: {page_url})
- fiscal_year: Year (YYYY) if mentioned anywhere near the document, or null
- fiscal_quarter: Quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, FY) if mentioned, or null

For PAGINATION LISTING PAGES (pagination only):
- title: Link text (e.g., "Next", "Page 2", "Previous", "Load More")
- url: The FULL URL
- purpose: Must be "pagination" or describe the pagination (e.g., "pagination - next page", "pagination - page 2")

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Extract ALL documents - don't filter or skip any
2. Look for documents in: <a> tags, buttons, table rows, list items, divs
3. Check for PDF links (.pdf), document detail pages, press release pages
4. Extract fiscal year/quarter from nearby text, headings, or URL
5. Convert all relative URLs to absolute URLs using base URL: {page_url}
6. Only include pagination links (Next, Previous, Page 2, etc.) as listing pages
7. DO NOT include section navigation links (SEC Filings, Press Releases, etc.)
8. EXCLUDE Excel, RTF, DOCX, HTML, etc. files - only include PDF links
9. EXCLUDE links to audio/video files or webcasts
10. EXCLUDE consolidated financial statements

            "purpose": "pagination - next page"
        }}}}
    ]
}}}}
