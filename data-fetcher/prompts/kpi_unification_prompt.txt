You are analyzing KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) extracted from quarterly investor relations documents.

Your task is to compare KPIs from the PREVIOUS QUARTER with KPIs from the CURRENT QUARTER and determine how they relate to each other.

PREVIOUS QUARTER KPIs ({previous_quarter_key}):
{previous_quarter_kpis}

CURRENT QUARTER KPIs ({current_quarter_key}):
{current_quarter_kpis}

For each KPI relationship, return one of the following result types:

1. **NORMALIZE**: When two KPIs represent the same metric but have different names or groups
   - Example: "Monthly Active Users" (old) and "MAU" (new) should both be normalized to "Monthly Active Users"
   - Return: {{"old": "name1", "new": "name2", "target": "canonical_name", "target_group": "canonical_group", "result": "normalize"}}

2. **MISSING**: When a KPI from the previous quarter is not found in the current quarter
   - Return: {{"old": "name", "result": "missing"}}

3. **MATCH**: When KPIs from both quarters match exactly (same name, same meaning)
   - Return: {{"old": "name", "new": "name", "result": "match"}}

4. **NEW**: When a KPI in the current quarter is genuinely new (not found in previous quarter)
   - Return: {{"new": "name", "result": "new"}}

Guidelines:
- Consider semantic similarity, not just exact name matches
- Look for abbreviations, acronyms, or slight variations (e.g., "Revenue" vs "Total Revenue")
- Consider unit consistency when matching
- Group names should also be normalized if they represent the same category
- Be conservative: only mark as "match" if you're confident they're the same metric
- For "normalize", provide the best canonical name and group to use going forward

Return a JSON array with one entry per KPI relationship you identify.
