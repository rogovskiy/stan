You are analyzing KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) extracted from quarterly investor relations documents.

Your task is to compare KPIs from the PREVIOUS QUARTER with KPIs from the CURRENT QUARTER and determine how they relate to each other.

PREVIOUS QUARTER KPIs ({previous_quarter_key}):
{previous_quarter_kpis}

CURRENT QUARTER KPIs ({current_quarter_key}):
{current_quarter_kpis}

For each KPI relationship, return one of the following result types. **CRITICAL: Use EXACTLY the fields specified for each result type - do not add extra fields or use different field names.**

1. **NORMALIZE**: When two KPIs represent the same metric but have different names or groups
   - Example: "Monthly Active Users" (previous) and "MAU" (current) should both be normalized to "Monthly Active Users"
   - **REQUIRED FIELDS**: previous, current, target, target_group, result
   - **EXACT FORMAT**: {{"previous": "name_from_previous_quarter", "current": "name_from_current_quarter", "target": "canonical_name_to_use", "target_group": "canonical_group_to_use", "result": "normalize"}}
   - **DO NOT USE**: Do not use "target" or "target_group" for other result types

2. **MISSING**: When a KPI from the previous quarter is not found in the current quarter
   - **REQUIRED FIELDS**: previous, result
   - **EXACT FORMAT**: {{"previous": "name_from_previous_quarter", "result": "missing"}}
   - **DO NOT INCLUDE**: Do not include "current", "target", or "target_group" fields

3. **MATCH**: When KPIs from both quarters match exactly (same name, same meaning)
   - **REQUIRED FIELDS**: previous, current, result
   - **EXACT FORMAT**: {{"previous": "name_from_previous_quarter", "current": "name_from_current_quarter", "result": "match"}}
   - **DO NOT INCLUDE**: Do not include "target" or "target_group" fields

4. **NEW**: When a KPI in the current quarter is genuinely new (not found in previous quarter)
   - **REQUIRED FIELDS**: target, target_group, result
   - **EXACT FORMAT**: {{"target": "name_from_current_quarter", "target_group": "group_name", "result": "new"}}
   - **DO NOT INCLUDE**: Do not include "previous" or "current" fields
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use "target" field to specify the KPI name and "target_group" to specify the group

Guidelines:
- **Use "normalize" for name variations**: If KPIs have different names but represent the same metric (e.g., "Net Sales" vs "Revenue", "Growth" vs "Growth YoY", "MAU" vs "Monthly Active Users"), use "normalize"
- **Use "match" only for identical names**: Only use "match" when names are exactly the same (or differ only by capitalization/whitespace)
- Consider semantic similarity when deciding between "normalize" vs "match"
- Look for abbreviations, acronyms, or slight variations - these should be "normalize", not "match"
- Consider unit consistency when matching
- Group names should also be normalized if they represent the same category
- For "normalize", provide the best canonical name and group to use going forward
- **`group`** (required): Category for grouping related KPIs. The main purpose of the group is to combine the KPIs for the different segments; don't try to artificially reduce number of groups. Group names rarely change.

**FIELD REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY:**
- **normalize**: MUST include: previous, current, target, target_group, result
- **missing**: MUST include: previous, result (NO current, target, or target_group)
- **match**: MUST include: previous, current, result (NO target or target_group)
- **new**: MUST include: target, target_group, result (NO previous or current)

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: 
- For "new" results, use "target" and "target_group" fields to specify the KPI name and group
- Both "normalize" and "new" results use "target" and "target_group" fields
- Do not mix field names - use exactly what is specified for each result type

Return a JSON array with one entry per KPI relationship you identify.
