Each chart should help visualize important trends or comparisons mentioned in the highlights.

       - Explanation: A brief explanation of why this valuation method is appropriate for this company (e.g., "EPS is the primary valuation method because the company has stable, predictable earnings and a history of consistent EPS growth")
       - Preference Order: Assign a number starting from 1 (most preferred) to indicate the order of preference
     - Include all applicable methods (can be multiple). For example, a mature cash-generating company might use both EPS (preference 1) and FCF (preference 2) methods.
   - Business Model Chart: Extract charting specification for the business model. This should be 1 bar chart with annual frequency showing the most important metric that drives value estimation for this business and supports the valuation methods. Select the single most important metric from the available metrics list that best represents the company's value driver (e.g., Revenue for revenue-driven companies, EPS for earnings-driven companies, FCF for cash-generating companies, or a custom KPI if it's the primary value driver). This chart supports the valuation by visualizing the key metric used in the valuation methods.
