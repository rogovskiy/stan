Overview

Different industries follow fundamentally different “secular physics.”
Because of this, an investment-analysis agent must apply different phased frameworks depending on the company’s business model and sector.

Although the initial phase (high uncertainty) and the final phase (maturity/decline) look superficially similar across industries, the drivers, risks, and asymmetry vectors differ in important ways.

This document defines:

Sector-specific phase models

Key characteristics of each stage

The nuances unique to each industry

What is common across sectors

How an agent should adapt its logic

🧠 1. Frontier Technology Framework

(AI, Quantum Computing, Biotech, Deep Tech, EV startups)

Phases

Phase 0 — Frontier / Nascent
Research-stage, no commercial traction, narrative-driven

Phase 1 — Early Validation
Technical milestones met, small pilots, roadmap credibility

Phase 2 — Adoption S-Curve
Market begins adopting; moats (ecosystems, IP) form

Phase 3 — Platform Dominance
High ROIC, ecosystem lock-in, industry standardization

Phase 4 — Optionality Expansion
New S-curves (e.g., NVDA inference, GOOG Cloud)

Phase 5 — Mature Compounder
EPS-driven, capital-return phase

Nuance

Highest uncertainty in Phase 0 of any model

Requires EV trees and binary-outcome modeling

Progress measured by milestones, not cash flow

Valuation based on probability distributions

⛏️ 2. Mining Framework

(Gold, Copper, Lithium, Uranium)

Phases

Phase 0 — Exploration
Geological data, drill results, pure optionality

Phase 1 — Development
Feasibility studies, permitting, heavy capex, dilution risk

Phase 2 — Early Production
First ounces, cost discovery (AISC), leverage to commodity prices

Phase 3 — Full Production
Stable output, cash flow, higher predictability

Phase 4 — Expansion / M&A
New deposits or acquisitions

Phase 5 — Depletion / Harvest
Reserves decline; valuation compresses

Nuance

Commodity price = primary driver (macro-sensitive)

Country/political risk deeply affects valuation

Resource depletion is a structural terminal risk

⚡ 3. Energy Producer Framework

(Oil & Gas, LNG, Coal)

Phases

Phase 0 — Pre-Discovery
Exploration wells, seismic, high uncertainty

Phase 1 — Development
Infrastructure build-out, debt financing

Phase 2 — Production Ramp-Up
Rapid cash flow improvement as volume grows

Phase 3 — Peak Cash Flow / Harvest
Dividends, buybacks, low growth

Phase 4 — Decline Curve / Terminal Phase
Natural resource depletion unless new assets acquired

Nuance

Cycle-based rather than innovation-based

Macro conditions (OPEC, geopolitics, demand) dominate

Huge operating leverage to commodity price changes

🌱 4. Renewables / Clean Energy Framework

(Solar, Wind, Hydrogen, Batteries)

Phases

Phase 0 — R&D Pilot
Unproven technology, grants

Phase 1 — Commercial Demonstration
Early deployments, high subsidies

Phase 2 — Subsidy-Driven Scaling
Growth dependent on policy and financing

Phase 3 — Maturity / Competition
Margins compress as tech commoditizes

Phase 4 — Utility-Like Behavior
Returns stabilize, cost of capital dominates

Nuance

Hyper-sensitive to government support

Financing conditions dictate viability

Long-term returns resemble utilities

🏢 5. REIT Framework

(Office, Retail, Industrial, Residential, Storage, Healthcare)

Phases

Phase 0 — Development / Stabilization
Construction risk, lease-up risk

Phase 1 — Occupancy Growth
NOI rising, cap-rate volatility

Phase 2 — Stabilized NOI
Predictable AFFO; re-rating potential

Phase 3 — Portfolio Scaling
Acquisitions drive external growth

Phase 4 — Mature REIT
Lower growth, high payout ratios

Phase 5 — Repositioning / Decline
Aging assets, falling rents, capex burden

Nuance

Cost of capital and interest rates dominate valuation

Leverage and payout ratios must be monitored

Cap rates replace growth metrics

🛒 6. Consumer Growth Framework

(Retail, CPG, Apparel, Beauty)

Phases

Phase 0 — Concept / Product Fit
Phase 1 — Regional Expansion
Phase 2 — National Scale / Brand Formation
Phase 3 — Mature Brand, Margin Expansion
Phase 4 — Saturation / Slowdown

Nuance

Moats built via distribution, brand equity, customer loyalty

Phase 3–4 often sees multiple compression

New category expansion can reset the S-curve

💾 7. SaaS / Software Platform Framework

(Cloud, Enterprise SaaS, Platforms)

Phases

Phase 0 — Pre-PMF (Pre-Product/Market Fit)
Phase 1 — PMF Achieved
Phase 2 — Hypergrowth
Phase 3 — Efficiency / Rule of 40
Phase 4 — Mature Platform
Phase 5 — Value Tech (Low Growth)

Nuance

Recurring revenue makes phases measurable

Unit economics drive valuations

Expansion revenue (NRR) is key to Phase 2–3 transitions

🚗 8. Automotive / Durable Goods Framework

(TSLA, GM, F, BYD)

Phases

Phase 0 — Prototype Stage
Phase 1 — First Production Line
Phase 2 — Scaling Manufacturing
Phase 3 — Competitive Pressure / Margin Compression
Phase 4 — Mature OEM

Nuance

Capex-heavy scaling (Phase 2) is the breakout or bankruptcy moment

Margins naturally compress in Phase 3

Innovation cadence dictates longevity

🧱 9. Industrials / Capital Equipment Framework

(SMCI, CAT, DE, Teradyne)

Phases

Phase 0 — R&D / Prototype
Phase 1 — First Customers
Phase 2 — Industrial Adoption
Phase 3 — Installed Base Dominance
Phase 4 — Replacement Cycle / Services Revenue

Nuance

Installed base is a massive moat in Phase 3

Recurring service revenue stabilizes late phases

Replacement cycles create rhythmic earnings patterns

💳 10. Financial Institutions Framework

(Banks, Insurers, Exchanges, Payment Networks)

Phases

Phase 0 — Startup Fintech
Phase 1 — Scaling Fintech
Phase 2 — Mature Regulated Entity
Phase 3 — Capital Return Machine

Nuance

Regulation creates barriers and also stifles growth

Mature phases resemble utilities

Unit economics (spread, underwriting, float) matter more than “growth”

🔥 Common Initial Phase Across All Sectors (Phase 0)

Despite sector differences, Phase 0 always means:

Highest uncertainty

Weak or no cash flow

Volatility extreme

Narrative-driven valuation

Optionality is the primary value driver

Position sizing is critical

But risk type differs:

Tech → science risk

Mining → geology risk

Energy → drilling risk

REIT → lease-up risk

SaaS → PMF risk

🔥 Common Final Phase Across All Sectors (Maturity/Decline)

Across industries, the late phase shares:

Low top-line growth

EPS / FCF drives returns

Valuation multiples compress

Capital allocation (dividends, buybacks) dominates

Risk shifts from growth to sustainability

But terminal drag differs:

Mining → depletion

REITs → capex reinvestment

SaaS → competition/commoditization

Consumer → brand aging
